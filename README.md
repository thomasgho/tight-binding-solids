# tight-binding-solids

An implementation of simple tight-binding models to allow the calculation of band structure of various crystals. One notebook looks at the tight-binding method to model Silicon, an attractive approach due to its simplicity of requiring only a few empirical parameters to calculate a relatively accurate approximation - far simpler than those of the pseudopotential method or density functional theory. The other notebook looks at building a general tight-binding model of an idealised solid (a 1D chain of atoms), which is a useful conceptual exercise from which to build more complex models. The parameters can be changed to for any length chain and any type of atom.
